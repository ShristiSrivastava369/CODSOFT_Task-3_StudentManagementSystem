        <h2>About Website</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our website! This platform has been meticulously crafted using Spring Boot by Shristi Srivastava. At the core of this website is the 'Student' entity class, coupled with a repository access layer. Shristi has ingeniously designed a service class brimming with logic to seamlessly execute Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on student data. Furthermore, to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing experience, Thymeleaf has been judiciously employed for the frontend development. Our controller class is the bridge that connects it all, efficiently handling URL requests and delivering an interactive interface for you to explore and interact with our student data. We're excited to have you here and hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
